We wanted to share our immense gratitude for your support during launch week, seriously, thank you all so much from everyone on the Monster Hunter team, you rock!\n\nThanks to you, the Steam community, Monster Hunter Wilds became Capcom’s most successful PC launch to date with a truly massive concurrent player count of 1,384,608, putting the game in Steam top 5 games of all-time for concurrent players. By comparison, Monster Hunter: World had a peak of 334,684, so that’s quite the jump!\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44795648/b231ebfb169ed52e7988e47feeaea448c10ead75.jpg[/img]\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds also hit a milestone of over 8 million copies sold across all platforms in just the first three days following launch, which has left us truly humbled by such amazing support.\n\nThis is just the start for the next generation of Monster Hunter, and we look forward to taking the next steps with you.\n\n\n[h1]Patches, Fixes and Community Feedback[/h1]\n\nSpeaking of next steps, let’s talk about what we’ve addressed since launch, and what’s next on the community feedback front.\n\nSince launch, you’ve probably seen us deploy a couple of patches that addressed priority issues such as:\n[list]\n[*]Progression blockers\n[*]Game stability\n[*]Gameplay bugs\n[/list]\nThese were, in the grand scheme of things, relatively quick fixes, allowing us to move quickly and address them thanks to player reports.\n\nThe team are currently working through other known issues, including network errors, crash issues and more.\n\nA list of currently known issues can be found [url=https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060]HERE[/url].\n\n\n[b]Community Feedback[/b]\n\nAs previously mentioned, the team have been meticulously going through player feedback here on the Steam forums, in Steam reviews, social media channels, community hubs and more.\n\nWe’ve been collating everything we’re seeing, from the positive, to constructive and negative. This includes current community hot topics too.\n\nWhilst we’re not quite ready to talk in more detail about this today, we wanted to reassure you that we’re watching, listening and working away behind the scenes. When we have more news to share with you, we will!\n\nThank you for your patience, support and feedback in the meantime!\n\n\n[h1]What’s Next?[/h1]\n\nAs we previously mentioned, launch really is just the start for the next generation of Monster Hunter!\n\nThe game’s first two free Event Quests are live now, giving you the opportunity to craft an adorable new piece of headgear, as well as stock up on your Kunafa Cheese supplies! More Event Quests will be released on a regular basis moving forward, so keep a look out for them. If you’d like to see what’s coming in the next few weeks, you can do so with our Event Quest info page [url=https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/event-quest/en-us/schedule]HERE[/url].\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44795648/5104d0c66917d242e14287154c76bac4ecf1b95a.jpg[/img]\n\nWe’ve also announced our first two free Title Updates, aptly named Title Update 1 and Title Update 2, which will bring even more content to the game!\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44795648/bb56ba26fe9d8d4b989c37bc6370ab56868f0a04.jpg[/img]\n\nWe recently revealed that Title Update 1 will be arriving early April and shared a little bit about what new content you’ll be receiving. Check it out below:\n\n[b]A New Level of Challenge![/b]\n\nPrepare your gear, and resolve, hunters!
